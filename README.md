# Using Machine Learning Regression Models to Predict the Outcome of Football Matches
#### The project aims to prdict the number of goals by a home and away team to help a betting company come up with odds for various matches. It also seeks to predict the outcome of a footbal match between team 1 and team 2.

## Libraries/Technologies
The libraries required for this project included:

      pandas - for performing data analysis and cleaning.

      numpy - used for fast matrix operations.

      matplotlib - used to create plots.

      seaborn - used for creating plots.  
      
      sklearn - machine learning library      
  
The language used was python3 and the regression models uesd for the project were  logistic and polynomial regression models. 

## Description
The objective of the project was to predict the number of goals scored by the home team, goals scored by the away team and the match outcome between team 1 and team 2.

To achieve these objectives, data cleaning, EDA and Modelling were conducted. 
For modelling, polynomial and logistic models were employed. In total, four models were created, two polynomial models, one logistic model and one xgboost classifier model.

To challenge the solution, xgboost classifier model was used. 

### Experiment Design
This project followed the CRISP-DM methodology for the experiment design. The CRISP-DM methodology has the following steps:
